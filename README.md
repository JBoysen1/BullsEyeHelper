Enter ownship coordinates as dash-separated values, eg. "220-50-45" (without the quotes). This means that you are on radial 220, 50 miles out, currently heading 045
Same with enemy except no heading: An enemy on radial 135, 80 miles out from bullseye should be entered as "135-80" (without the quotes). 
You may enter values with a prefixed zero, eg. 050 or 50 will work the same
